1. Awareness. My goal above. Each time you write function, ask yourself 
"How much of the domain type do I really accept? How tightly does the range type describe the output?" Aim to improve both.
 
2. Action. Invent precise types that describe your data. Validate unknown data and tag it with precise types if it passes validation.
Don't think that because your value is a subset of a built-in type, for example expressible by an Int or String, that that's good enough.
Use static typing like you believe in it, goddammit!

/** Some closing remarks...
 * 
 * In the Probability case study, we wanted to associated a new type with a Double value in [0, 1].
 * It isn't particularly easy in Scala ATM. We needed up having to wrap the value in a case class, so
 * type-level concerns ended up causing runtime impacts.
 * 
 * Haskell has a 'newtype' keyword which does what we wanted: takes an existing data value and 
 * gives it a new, separate type.
 * 
 * At the time of writing, a Inline Classes SIP (Scala Improvement Proposal) is in development 
 * which may offer a future means to introduce newtypes without boxing.
